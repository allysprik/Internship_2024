## Description
This  folder contains the files I used to generate the variations of the model for the internship. 

## Files
- `R_Add_MRIMI.rmd`: This file contains the code to generate the model without platelets but with the imaging MI node.
- `R_Add_MRIMI_TCGA.rmd`: This file contains the code to generate the model without platets, with the imaging MI node and with the TCGA data.
- `R_Add_TCGA.rmd`: This file contains the code to generate several variations of the model without platelets but with the TCGA data.
- `R_Original_Train.rmd`: This file contains the code to generate the model without platelets and without the additions.
- `R_WP_Train.rmd`: This file generates the models with platelets and with and without various additions. This file also creates the local training tables for the models, which are used in for imaging MI and TCGA nodes.
